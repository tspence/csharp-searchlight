		<description>Implements the Searchlight REST query language for CSharp.  The Searchlight language is database neutral and can support most database technologies.  Using Searchlight, you can provide a rich query language via your API, while still being completely safe from SQL injection attacks.  Searchlight enables you to use multiple database engines with the same functionality, and to transform queries using the in-memory abstract syntax tree prior to execution.</description>
		<summary>Be fully database independent with the Searchlight query parser and execution engine for your REST API.</summary>
		<releaseNotes>
			# 0.9.7
			September 22, 2021

			Searchlight queries now support date shorthand: TODAY, TOMORROW, YESTERDAY can be used as values for date criteria.
			This means you can now write queries such as `date between yesterday and tomorrow`.  We may add more support for
			date constants in the future.
			
			* LINQ executor sorts results according to the same logic as the SQL executor
			* LINQ executor works correctly if you send in a null or filter statement
			* Recognizes "ascending" and "descending" in addition to "asc" and "desc" for sort orders
			* Removed references to Dapper, which is no longer required to compile

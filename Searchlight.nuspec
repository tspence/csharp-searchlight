		<description>Implements the Searchlight REST query language for CSharp.  The Searchlight language is database neutral and can support most database technologies.  Using Searchlight, you can provide a rich query language via your API, while still being completely safe from SQL injection attacks.  Searchlight enables you to use multiple database engines with the same functionality, and to transform queries using the in-memory abstract syntax tree prior to execution.</description>
		<summary>Be fully database independent with the Searchlight query parser and execution engine for your REST API.</summary>
		<releaseNotes>
			# 0.9.15
			December 14, 2021

			Changes to engine-level configuration values.

			* Maximum parameter count and maximum page size values can be configured at the engine level.
			* Added support for SQL Server performance tuning features: NOCOUNT, READ UNCOMMITTED, and WITH NOLOCK.
			* NOCOUNT and READ UNCOMMITTED are enabled by default.  Since Searchlight queries do not rely on "records affected", and since searchlight is a nondestructive query system, these options will reduce contention and enable higher performance queries.  If you require precision in your query results, you can disable READ UNCOMMITTED at the engine level.
			* Began work on Searchlight for MongoDB.  Expect more soon!
